- fire-and-forget, errors in log only, 200 unless invalid format/args
    our main concern is making sure the request from the sender finishes
    quickly
- docs - about the name
- how to log at differing levels in twistd
- heartbeat - SSL LB problems?
- ssl snoop?
- override methods to get better debugging of parent class?
- JSON via socket
- global config vars passed to methods as hashes instead of independent variables
- examples - socket and http in most languages
- init script, daemonize
- auth keys? strings?
- config.cfg -> config.yaml
- gevent???
