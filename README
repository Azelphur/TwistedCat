Usage:
1) Edit config.cfg, remove any sections you don't want, Each section
supports multiple accounts, meaning you can have the bot on multiple IRC
networks, or multiple XMPP accounts.
2) Start the bot with twistd -y twistedcat.tac
3) Send stuff to the bot using netcat. Example:
echo "Hello, world!" | netcat localhost 1079

Optional:
Put the twistedcat shell script in /usr/bin for easy access
(example: echo "Hello, world!" | twistedcat)

About:
This is a simple little IRC bot I created in about 30 minutes using python and twisted 
for use on my gaming communities server, it notifies us of available updates, servers
going up/down, and other similar things I got the idea from last.fm's irccat, which is
very similar. Except I didn't want all of the extra commands. I also like python and
twisted, so I wrote it myself. :)

A few people in #ubuntu-uk became interested, so I spruced it up a bit, and added XMPP 
support. Enjoy! :D

The IRC protocol code came from here:
