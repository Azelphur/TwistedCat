This is a simple little IRC bot I created in about 30 minutes using python and twisted 
for use on my gaming communities server, it notifies us of available updates, servers
going up/down, and other similar things I got the idea from last.fm's irccat, which is
very similar. Except I didn't want all of the extra commands. I also like python and
twisted, so I wrote it myself. :)

The IRC protocol code came from here: http://eflorenzano.com/blog/2008/11/16/writing-markov-chain-irc-bot-twisted-and-python/

Usage:
Edit the lines in service.tac to point to your IRC server/channel
Start the bot with twistd -y service.tac
Send stuff to the bot using netcat. Example: echo "Hello, world!" | netcat localhost 1079

Optional:
Put irc in /usr/bin so you can pipe directly to irc rather than using netcat.
